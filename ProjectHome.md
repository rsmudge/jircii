jIRCii is an internet relay chat client for MacOS X, Windows, and Linux. Pretend ircii and mIRC had a baby. Now pretend that BitchX was the real father. That's jIRCii.

If you were on IRC in the mid to late nineties, this is your client.

## It's Scriptable ##

jIRCii has a history of backwards compatibility and a legacy of [70+ scripts](http://jircii.dashnine.org/scripts.html) contributed by members of its community. jIRCii is fully scriptable, using [The Sleep Scripting Language](http://sleep.dashnine.org/). Pick and choose the features you want or roll your own.
